**CryptoManagement Contract**

**Description:**
The CryptoManagement contract is a solidity smart contract designed to manage crypto tokens. It provides functionality for setting token values and processing token transactions.

**License:**
This software is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for details.

**Usage:**
1. Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. The deployer becomes the crypto holder, having exclusive rights to certain functions.
3. The crypto holder can set values for different tokens using the `setTokenValue` function.
4. Users can interact with the contract by calling the `processTokenTransaction` function to offer a value for a specific token.

**Functions:**
1. `setTokenValue(uint256 tokenId, uint256 value) external onlyCryptoHolder`: Allows the crypto holder to set the value of a token identified by its ID.

2. `processTokenTransaction(uint256 tokenId, uint256 offeredValue) external`: Allows users to process token transactions by offering a value for a token identified by its ID. The function ensures that the offered value is valid and deducts it from the token's value if accepted.
